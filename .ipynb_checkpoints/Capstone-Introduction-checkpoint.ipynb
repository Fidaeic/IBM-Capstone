    "1. What kind of data can we retrieve from Foursquare and how many calls are we allowes to make to the API?\n",
    "2. Since I live in Spain and I wanted to study a Spanish city, what are the main sources of open data available?\n",
    "3. Is the available information enough to carry a study related to geolocated venues?\n",

    "In order to find out what are the prefered and most frequent food venues, and whether if there are any coincidences in the results, the following data has been used:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Foursquare data retrieved from the \"explore\" endpoint.** We can get the following information:\n",
    "    * Name of the venue.\n",
    "    * Location (latitude and longitude).\n",
    "    * Category.\n",
    "    \n",
    "There is a limit of 99.500 calls/day, which is a broad limit given the amount of data that is going to take to carry the project\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Foursquare data retrieved from the \"details\" endpoint.** The following information will be used:\n",
    "    * Name of the venue.\n",
    "    * Rating.\n",
    "    * Count of likes.\n",
    "    \n",
    "In this case, the number of calls is much more limited, since a Personal account has only 500 calls/day.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Geospatial data from the open data platform of the City Hall of M치laga.** The data is available if .shp format, wich contained the outline of the neighbourhoods of the city. With the help of the software QGIS, the centroids of the polygons have been calculated and their coordinates have been exported in .json format, in order to work with them easily with the json package. \n",
    "\n",
    "The reason why the city of M치laga was chosen is because it is one of the few Spanish cities that has an open data portal with geospatial data. Moreover, it is a very touristic city, which means that there is a great number of restauration venues that are likely to be rated by customers."
